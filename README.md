# Steamgifts User Notes
The script adds a "Notes" icon on the profile page of a user, right next to the "Visit Steam profile" button. On hovering over the button, it shows all the saved notes for this user. There are different types of notes:

* Basic Comment
* Added to whitelist
* Removed from whitelist
* Added to blacklist
* Removed from blacklist

Every time you add or remove somebody from you blacklist or whitelist, the script asks you for a little comment stating the reason for this decision. If you don't feel like typing in a reason, you can just ignore or dismiss the input box. The script will save the action and a default comment like "Added to Whitelist". This way, you always have a complete history of your actions regarding this user. 
By clicking on the "Notes" icon, you can add a basic comment that is not bound to any action.
